In order to complete this challenge I had to research and ended up using the following code lines from another student as reference:

"
Quan = Final_Tumor_df.groupby(["Drug Regimen"]).quantile([.25,.75],numeric_only=True)
for treatment in Treatment_List:
    # Locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and get the tumor volumes
    Current_df = Final_Tumor_df.loc[treatment]
    
    # add subset
    Tumor_Plot.append(Current_df["Tumor Volume (mm3)"])
    
    # Determine outliers using upper and lower bounds
    lower_q = Quan["Tumor Volume (mm3)"].loc[(treatment,0.25)]
    upper_q = Quan["Tumor Volume (mm3)"].loc[(treatment,0.75)]
    iqr = upper_q - lower_q
    
    lower_bound = lower_q - 1.5*iqr
    upper_bound = upper_q + 1.5*iqr
    outliers = Current_df["Tumor Volume (mm3)"].loc[(Current_df["Tumor Volume (mm3)"] < lower_bound) | \
                              (Current_df["Tumor Volume (mm3)"] > upper_bound)]
    print(f"{treatment}'s potential outliers: {outliers}")
    "
